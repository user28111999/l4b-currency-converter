# l4b-currency-converter

You need to practice ReactJS and a bit of CSS? Here you go, just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. ðŸ˜‰

You'll be making an app that converts one currency to another (e.g. Â£ to â‚¬) 

Simple right?

## Requirements

Follow the rules:

- Function based components
- Usage of hooks
- Your page needs to be responsive without using the following CSS attribute: `@media` (You can style the page however you want)
- When converting your currency make sure it is humanly-readable!

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Initialize your react app
3. Code!
4. When the app is done, be sure to make a pull request so I can review it.

Good luck!

## Hints (optional)

- You can use the following API or this npm package to gather data about currencies.
- Use the power of flexbox!
