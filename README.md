# l4b-currency-converter

You need to practice ReactJS and a bit of CSS? Here you go, just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. ðŸ˜‰

You'll be making an app that converts one currency to another (e.g. Â£ to â‚¬) 

Simple right?

## Requirements

Follow the rules:

- Function based components
- Usage of hooks
- Your page needs to be responsive without using the following CSS attribute: `@media` (You can style the page however you want)
- When converting your currency make sure it is humanly-readable!
- You need to deploy it with the hosting service of your choice

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Initialize your react app
3. Code!
4. When the app is done, be sure to make a pull request with a link of the deployed app so I can review it.

Good luck!

## Hints (optional)

Although, optional. Here are some tips:

- You can use the following [API](https://currencyapi.net/ "API") or this [npm package](https://github.com/paul-shuvo/nodejs-currency-converter "npm package") to gather data about currencies.
- Use the power of flexbox!
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com "Heroku") and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify") can be used for the deployment.
- Be sure to **read** the documentation of the API/Package you're using.
